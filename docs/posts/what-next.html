<p>In my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-Andrew-Hunt/dp/020161622X">Pragmatic Programmer</a> the authors talk about your 'learning portfolio'. The assumption being that you should treat your learning like an investment portfolio and invest your time in topics depending on risk.</p>
<p>2021 is my 4th year as a developer and I've been processing my learning portfolio a lot lately.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My current learning portfolio is made up from high risk areas (embedded, machine learning, robotics), medium risk (web security), and low risk (web frameworks, web native, AWS cloud).</p>
<h2>What is my risk?</h2>
<p>Risk tolerance is unique to everyone. For me I'm in a high risk stage at the minute.</p>
<p>This means that I can afford to explore a lot and not really care about consequences to my career.</p>
<p>I actually don't see programming as a career, it more of a profession - it something I myself doing for the rest of my life. The fact that I get paid for it is a really nice bonus.</p>
<pre><code>const risk = timeInvestment * ultimateReward;
</code></pre>
<p>Risk has nothing to do with fun and it's mainly related to return - can I make a living or make money from it.</p>
<p>Choosing a high risk learning area is unlikely to payoff now, but it might return a bigger reward in the future as technology progresses.</p>
<p>High risk areas are more likely to be harder topics or use knowledge that you don't necessarily have right now.</p>
<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
<h3>Modern JS frameworks (low risk)</h3>
<p>React is a preference for me and I've made a salary from React since the beginning.</p>
<p>I know enough of React now that it doesn't take a lot of time for me to keep up with releases, new patterns, and features.</p>
<p>The time I've spent in the ecosystem has allowed to encounter problems with React performance, and tooling.</p>
<p>Right now my favourite way to write React is within NextJS, library that still uses React for the design whilst adding some nice features for Server-Side Rendered apps and static file generation. NextJS is flexible enough to allow a lot of config, but they provide conventions around common sticking points with React.</p>
<p>Following that pattern I'm also really excited by NestJS, which looks to do the same for Node / Express apis.</p>
<h4>Notable mentions</h4>
<p>I care about the JAMstack because I like the performance benefits. I keep an eye on new releases and I read tutorials for Eleventy and RedwoodJS. Same goes for JAM platforms: Zeit, Netlify.</p>
<p>I also like VueJS as a framework and I admire their performance focus and the fact that it's a community-driven project. I'm not interested in moving to VueJS just yet, so my interest is shallow - reading and tutorials.</p>
<p>I found React to be 'good enough' from a performance perspective (only relative to European customer bases), but as I'm looking into embedded websites I'm starting to research lighter weight options. Preact is a clear option here since there's little rework required. Also considering and testing Svelte, but it comes with a bit of a refactor from React.</p>
<h3>Web Native and DIY (low risk)</h3>
<p>This is a preference and an area of learning.</p>
<p>My preference is to DIY something over using a module - when I use a module it really has to be a flywheel.</p>
<p>When it comes to frontends, I tend to lean towards building everything from scratch. My experience with accessibility has force me down this path and I find it more flexible than reusing components from a library and trying to edit them.</p>
<p>This also means that I need to keep tabs on browser API releases, Javascript language releases, CSS releases and so on.</p>
<h3>AWS Cloud (low risk)</h3>
<p>Fullstack development requires knowledge on how to build architectures. My preference here is AWS and I'm currently working through certifications on AWS.</p>
<p>This actually covers a lot of other topics: databases, AI services, hosting services, server management security and so much more. I categorise all of that together because it's easier to track.</p>
<h3>Embedded Development (high risk)</h3>
<p>Learning more about FPGA and micro-controller development. Currently learning about building drivers for sensors, algorithms for measuring uncertainty, and building multi sensor systems.</p>
<h3>Machine Learning (high risk)</h3>
<p>Having already spent a few years working with machine learning algorithms, it's still something I'm fascinated about.</p>
<p>It took a while to realise what I enjoy within the machines learning area and right now I'm excited about planetary observation using AI.</p>
<p>A recent example of this was using satellite imagery to detect economic well-being in rural India.</p>
<p>Object detection is my main passion here, but also interested in autonomous vehicles.</p>
<h3>Robotics (high risk)</h3>
<p>Embedded development and machine learning folds into robotics.</p>
<p>The main reason why I'm interested in robotics is to do with robotics aids or using robots to speed up a traditionally human based workflow.</p>
<p>One of the earliest robotics projects I planned was a farming drone that can detect plant growth issues.</p>
<h3>Web Security (medium risk)</h3>
<p>During the pandemic I start getting interested in cyber-security.</p>
<p>For my learning I'm currently learning everything about web security vulnerabilities, exploits, and tooling.</p>
<p>The main reason for this learning areas is to apply it to bug bounties and vulnerability disclosures.</p>
