<p>I use the Raspberry Pi a lot, they are great little devices for prototyping ideas and building projects.</p>
<p>Choosing an OS has been tricky because there are so many options out there.</p>
<p>My needs are usually simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>[ ] reliable OS</li>
<li>[ ] flexible OS</li>
<li>[ ] transferable skills</li>
<li>[ ] ROS support*</li>
<li>[ ] small footprint</li>
<li>[ ] solid support</li>
</ul>
<p>*This is a new requirement that has limited my choices a lot.</p>
<h2>What is my process</h2>
<p>I've recently started using <a href="https://www.ansible.com">Ansible</a> to run a set of commands on the Pi that can harden the OS and improve the security.</p>
<p>In general I just care about an OS that can take minutes to flash and is easy to SSH into via Ansible once connected to my network.</p>
<p>I'm planning to write a post on Ansible soon.</p>
<h2>What is the hardware?</h2>
<p>I prefer the standard RPi unit usually the 4GB or 8GB version.</p>
<p>Although I've tried the Pi Zero, I've not used it for projects recently. I would use it if I need the form factor, but using it will probably make me change the OS.</p>
<h2>What was I using?</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.hypriot.com">HypriotOS</a>, which is an OS that comes with Docker pre-installed.</p>
<p>Hypriot was also really easy to configure before mounting - it came with a clear documentation and the config files were easy to get to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the HypriotOS community and support is small at the minute and I've encountered a few issues with the OS.</p>
<p>I wanted to move away from it before support became a problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>🟡 reliable OS</li>
<li>✅ flexible OS</li>
<li>🟡 transferable skills</li>
<li>❌ ROS support*</li>
<li>✅ small footprint</li>
<li>❌ solid support</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's wrong with Raspberry Pi OS?</h2>
<p>Raspberry Pi OS (Raspian) was harder to set up in headless mode a few months ago. In my case I remember there being a lot of steps in order to set everything up.</p>
<p>I should test this again, but since my main requirement is not met (ROS support) I might not use it anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>🟡 easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>✅ reliable OS</li>
<li>✅ flexible OS</li>
<li>🟡 transferable skills</li>
<li>❌ ROS support*</li>
<li>✅ small footprint</li>
<li>✅ solid support</li>
</ul>
<h2>OS Study</h2>
<h3><a href="https://ubuntu.com/download">Ubuntu Server LTS 20.04</a></h3>
<p>Best option with a small footprint (until you update/upgrade). Support with ROS and Ubuntu itself is a popular OS in general which makes troubleshooting easy.</p>
<p>LTS stands for Long Term Support so I can reliably reuse this image for projects for the next few years.</p>
<p>This also means that it will be a popular option for enterprise clients too so all the skills learned are transferable, which I can't say the same about Raspberry Pi OS or HypriotOS.</p>
<p>The setup is simple because Ubuntu Server is included in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>✅ reliable OS</li>
<li>✅ flexible OS</li>
<li>✅ transferable skills</li>
<li>✅ ROS support*</li>
<li>🟡 small footprint</li>
<li>✅ solid support</li>
</ul>
<p>Not the smallest OS on the list, especially after updating and upgrading.</p>
<p>Result: best pick for now</p>
<h3><a href="https://alpinelinux.org/about/">Alpine Linux</a></h3>
<p>Huge fan of Alpine from Docker and I really wanted to make this work as my server driver.</p>
<p>Again the ROS requirement is a 'no-go', but for other project this could be an ideal OS.</p>
<p>The size and performance is awesome!</p>
<p>Skills learned through using the OS are not as transferable as Ubuntu, but you can reuse those skill if you ever deal with Docker instance - which is still a plus.</p>
<p>The setup on the site is a lot more complex that what I came up with</p>
<pre><code>// 1. Download the tar from the Alpine site

// 2. Create a bootable SD card using PI imager

// 3. Extract the tarball contents to the SD card.

tar -xvf alpine-rpi-3.13.2-aarch64.tar.gz -C {SD-card}

// 4. Pop the SD card into the Pi 
</code></pre>
<p>Annoyingly I need a desktop and peripherals in order to complete the setup.</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>✅ reliable OS</li>
<li>✅ flexible OS</li>
<li>✅ transferable skills</li>
<li>❌ ROS support*</li>
<li>✅ small footprint</li>
<li>✅ solid support</li>
</ul>
<p>Result: cannot complete the setup in headless mode</p>
<h2><a href="https://ubuntu.com/core">Ubuntu Core</a></h2>
<p>An OS specifically designed for embedded solutions.</p>
<p>Core has a lot of interesting features for embedded: OTA updates, secure boot, full disk encryption, recovery mode, and Snaps.</p>
<p>Everything apart from Snaps is awesome and as an ex-embedded developer I was drooling when I read about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/snaps-in-ubuntu-core">Snaps</a> are 🟡 for me. A lot of people are strongly against it, but I'm not one of them.</p>
<p>I can live with the format, but it does introduce a new step in the workflow: compiling your app to a Snap.</p>
<p>After a bit of reading I discovered the official Canonical advice re: Ubuntu Core:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be used as part of a set and forget system. For deployment please use Ubuntu Server</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That makes sense now and it's a serious contender for finished projects.</p>
<p>The setup is simple because Ubuntu Core is included in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a>.</p>
<p>Annoyingly though Ubuntu Core requires a desktop and peripherals in order to complete the setup.</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>✅ reliable OS</li>
<li>❌ flexible OS</li>
<li>❌ transferable skills</li>
<li>❌ ROS support*</li>
<li>✅ small footprint</li>
<li>✅ solid support</li>
</ul>
<p>I marked it down for flexibility because Ubuntu Core is not meant for development. Also marked it down for transferable skills since it seems like there's a lot of specific Ubuntu Core knowledge needed to make this work and those skills are not all transferable.</p>
<p>Result: cannot complete the setup in headless mode</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/skiffos/skiffos">SkiffOS</a></h2>
<p>Skiff is a lightweight OS and is very similar to HypriotOS.</p>
<p>It's built around Docker using Buildroot to produce a minimal 'single-file' host OS. 🤯</p>
<p>Another benefit here was the fact that I can configure the build before compilation so I can probably reduce the amount of work done on the machine to complete the setup.</p>
<p>The config files use <code>yaml</code> which is a super transferable skill in Docker and Cloud environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>🏁 easy headless setup (no monitor, keyboard, or mouse needed)</li>
<li>🏁 reliable OS</li>
<li>✅ flexible OS</li>
<li>✅ transferable skills</li>
<li>❌ ROS support*</li>
<li>✅ small footprint</li>
<li>🏁 solid support</li>
</ul>
<p>The setup seems easy enough but I had issues with the gcc and make so I couldn't actually try this out properly.</p>
<p>The fact that it comes with Docker pre-installed makes this a really 🌶 option for flexibility. It's also got a really small footprint depending on which layers you need and how many.</p>
<p>🏁 means that although I started testing, I couldn't make my mind just yet. SkiffOS is a new project so I won't be able to tell how they are with future support just yet.</p>
<p>Result: needs more testing in order to get a clear view</p>
